# PS4: N-Body Simulation

## Contact
Name: Jonathan Doughty
Section: 204
Time to Complete: 5 hours


## Description
Continues implementation from part a, adding dynamic movement to planets based on laws of physics.

### Features
Calculates planet position based on laws of physics. Uses step function to calculuate all the planet's new positions.

### Memory
Used smart pointers to hold planets

### Issues
There is an issue caused by some files (e.g. awesome.txt and its-a-trap.txt) where the textures don't read for some reason, even though the exact string information was stored correctly. This was a mystery and the issue can be solved by simply copy pasting the exact contents into a new file.

### Extra Credit
Implemented background image and plays eerie space music.

Also implemented time elapsed display in simulation, and created my own planet text file with two suns.
